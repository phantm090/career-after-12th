            </legend>
            In India, there is no specific exam for admission to a life coach certification program. However, 
            <br>
            <br>
            it is important to note that any coach worth their salt will have some sort of training under their belt 1.

On average, a typical life coaching program costs between $1,500 and $8,0001. Becoming a life coach is technically free, 
<br>
